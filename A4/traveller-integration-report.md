# Traveller Integration Report
<p>The team implementing our module did a very good job of following our specifications. All of our desired classes and functions were present, with the provided parameters and output data types. While the implementation of the Path_Query method was not what was envisioned, it is still a perfectly valid approach that fulfils the required parameters. There was only one part within the code where our specification was slightly altered, which was the location of two lists we requested: existing_players and existing_towns. These lists represent an overall list containing all of the players and towns within the current game. We had initially requested for these lists to be static fields within the Player class and Town class respectively, but they were moved to be global variables. This is a perfectly fine alteration of our spec, as the fields are still accessible from anywhere and can be used in all of the required functions. The provided reason for this change was so that the list would not have to be updated within the class with each player added. This reasoning did not seem entirely valid, but it did not directly affect anything else within the program.</p>
<p>The traveller-server implementation we received would be easily integrated into the traveller-client program we wrote. We designed our traveller-client to use the classes and methods specified in our module and given that the module was adhered to very well, the transition should be minimal. The estimated time for integration would be 30 minutes to an hour, because as mentioned earlier all of the methods were up to our specifications, so there were no unexpected changes that would have to be accounted for.</p>
<p>Given that the implementation was well thought out and executed, we believe that our specifications were reasonably defined. One change that could be made to our module would be the change that the group made, which was keeping existing_players and existing_towns as global variables. This is a reasonable change to the specification, as it enables these variables to be accessible from any method very easily.</p>
<p>A caveat to our module specification is that it was intended to operate as the server side code. As a result, the client implementation proved to be difficult, as our methods relied on the defined classes as the parameters for all of the functions. This made client implementation difficult because the server functions expected objects that were also returned by the server; it would have been easier if the server just returned these objects and only required the client to use primitive types to make function calls.</p>
