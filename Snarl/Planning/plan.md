#### Part 1:
<p>There are several components that make up the entire game. The first being the Player object. The player should have several fields, specifically a name or unique identifier, a location within the game map, something stating whether the player is currently alive (expelled or not), and lastly the options for a player’s valid moves. The valid moves are directional options of where to step presented that the player can choose. Players “can only see a limited area around them”, so their options should be constrained to their view. These move options can consist of a player moving 0-2 steps, as long as the destination is not occupied, ending with an interaction with the object on that tile (if there is one).</p>
<p>The second component is automated Adversaries. Adversaries should have similar components as players, such as the unique identifier, location, and valid move options. The key difference is adversaries will have complete insight to all objects across the level in all rooms, as well as  a different set of valid moves. These moves are constrained to moving 0-1 tile(s), ending with an interaction with any player on their ending tile (which will expel that player).</p>
<p>The last component of the game is the overall game software. This will have information about the game state, such as the turn type (player or adversary turn), a collection of the current players and adversaries, the locations and statuses of interactable objects (the key and exit portal), and the overall layout of the dungeon. The dungeon layout will contain information about each level, as well as the mapping of each room and how the rooms are connected. The game software will be responsible for handling all player and adversary information and moves, as well as specific interactions between game objects.</p>
<p>Each component listed above should have their game insight contained to only what is necessary. Adversaries need to know the layout of the entire current level, and all objects across that level. Players need to know the layout of their surroundings within their visible range, including any game objects. Players and adversaries must communicate with the game framework in order to perform valid moves. The overall game framework needs to know everything: all player and adversary information, the layout of the entire current level, and the location of other objects. The game framework will communicate with players and adversaries about valid and successful moves and tell players the results of any interaction including expulsion of any player, unlocking the exit portal and whether or not the level/game was won.</p>
<p>There will also be a certain amount of shared information, accessible by every game object. Common knowledge consists of: the current level, how many levels are left, how many players are still playing (not expelled in that level), the number of adversaries, and if the exit portal is unlocked.</p>
